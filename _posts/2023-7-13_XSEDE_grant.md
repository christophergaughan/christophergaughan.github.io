    "\n",
    "## Public Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose investigating the critical role of Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) in antibody-antigen interactions, specifically focusing on Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). As a key player in cancer immune evasion, PD-L1 disables T-cells by interacting with their PD-1 receptors, allowing cancer cells to evade immune detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therapies blocking this interaction, known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have emerged as promising tools in cancer treatment. However, their optimization requires a deeper understanding of the intricate protein-protein interactions involved, particularly the influence exerted by CDRs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach harnesses the power of deep learning tools such as Rosetta and ![AlphaFold Logo](URL-to-AlphaFold-logo-if-available) AlphaFold to predict 3D structures of antibody-PD-L1 complexes based on sequence data, thus unveiling the structural consequences of modifications in CDRs. We will then use Molecular Dynamics simulations to probe the dynamics and stability of these complexes, followed by MMPBSA calculations to estimate the binding free energy (∆G) between the antibody and PD-L1. This method provides a quantitative metric of the impact of CDR changes on binding affinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We intend to employ ACCESS's high-performance computing resources to facilitate these demanding calculations and manage the resulting extensive datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Appropriateness of Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research strategy is grounded in established methodologies for exploring protein-protein interactions. We will use trusted software (Rosetta, AlphaFold) and a well-regarded Molecular Dynamics package (AMBER) to predict structures, simulate complex dynamics, and calculate binding affinities using MMPBSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Appropriateness of Research Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Our plan is composed of a series of computational experiments, each building upon previous findings. We aim to explore our research questions using proven computational biochemistry methodologies comprehensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficient Use of Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilize the requested resources effectively and efficiently, in line with our proposed methodology. This will include streamlining simulation parameters and parallelizing jobs wherever possible to maximize resource use efficiency. Specifically, we will optimize CPU/GPU/VM usage to ensure an optimal balance of computation power and resource consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supporting Grant Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "While external grants do not support this project, the Principal Investigator (PI) brings a wealth of expertise in Linux, Python, Molecular Dynamics (specifically with AMBER), MMPBSA, Rosetta, and relevant bioinformatics databases. This expertise ensures the availability of necessary human resources for the proposed work's successful completion. The PI's track record of productivity and scholarly outputs guarantees the project's intellectual merit. The allocation request aligns with the project's objectives, and the resource usage scale aligns with the proposed work's nature and purpose.\n",
