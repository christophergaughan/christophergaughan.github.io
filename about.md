I'm a computational scientist with a Ph.D. in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, specializing in the intersection of molecular biology, machine learning, and rigorous statistical analysis.

My current work focuses on **antibody developability assessment**—identifying post-translational modification liabilities (particularly glycosylation risks) that AI-driven protein design tools often miss. I bridge the gap between computationally designed biologics and manufacturing reality.

## Technical Focus

- **Molecular Simulations**: AMBER, molecular dynamics, protein structure analysis
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, scikit-learn, CNN-LSTM architectures for binding prediction
- **Bayesian Statistics**: Probabilistic modeling, uncertainty quantification
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes

## Background

Over 10 years of experience applying computational methods to biological problems, including:

- Antibody glycoform heterogeneity modeling
- RNA-seq analysis and liver transcriptomics
- Clinical trial data analysis
- Large-scale trajectory data processing (100+ TB)

I value scientific rigor, reproducibility, and the ability to communicate complex findings clearly.
